📉 Gold & Silver “Crash” — Social Media Panic vs Market Reality
📌 Project Overview

During a recent decline in Gold and Silver prices, social media platforms were flooded with terms like “crash”, “wipeout”, and “manipulation”.
This project aims to verify whether that panic was justified using market data instead of sentiment.

Rather than predicting prices or analyzing social media posts directly, this study focuses on a data-driven validation of the claims made online.

🎯 Objective

To determine whether the recent fall in Gold and Silver qualifies as:

A market crash, or

A normal correction amplified by social media exaggeration

📊 Data Sources

The analysis uses daily price data for:

Gold

Silver

S&P 500 (equity market benchmark)

US Dollar Index (DXY)

All datasets were sourced from publicly available financial data providers and aligned on common trading dates to ensure fair comparison.

🔍 Methodology

The following standard market risk metrics were applied:

Daily Returns (%) – to measure sudden price drops

Maximum Drawdown (%) – to distinguish correction vs crash

7-Day Rolling Volatility – to detect panic-driven instability

Cross-Asset Comparison – to check if the stress was market-wide or asset-specific

Crash benchmarks used:

Single-day fall ≥ 10%

Drawdown ≥ 20%

📈 Key Findings

Gold and Silver experienced sharp declines, but did not meet crash-level thresholds

Maximum drawdowns:

Gold ≈ –10%

Silver ≈ –14%

Volatility spiked temporarily, especially in Silver, but normalized afterward

The broader equity market (S&P 500) showed limited stress, confirming the move was asset-specific

No statistical evidence supports claims of structural market manipulation

✅ Conclusion

The analysis indicates that the event was a correction, not a crash.
Social media reactions significantly amplified short-term fear, while market data shows a controlled, macro-driven adjustment — with Silver exhibiting higher risk than Gold.
