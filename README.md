# 📉 Gold & Silver “Crash” — Social Media Panic vs Market Reality

## 📌 Project Overview
During a recent decline in Gold and Silver prices, social media platforms were flooded with terms like *“crash”*, *“wipeout”*, and *“manipulation”*.  
This project verifies whether that panic was justified using **market data rather than sentiment**.

Instead of predicting prices or scraping social media posts, this analysis focuses on a **data-driven reality check** of widely shared claims.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To determine whether the recent fall in Gold and Silver qualifies as:
- A **market crash**, or  
- A **normal correction amplified by social media exaggeration**

---

## 📊 Data Sources
Daily price data was collected for:
- Gold  
- Silver  
- S&P 500 (equity market benchmark)  
- US Dollar Index (DXY)  

All datasets were aligned on **common trading dates** to ensure accurate cross-market comparison.

---

## 🔍 Methodology
The following standard market risk metrics were used:

- **Daily Returns (%)** – to capture sharp price movements  
- **Maximum Drawdown (%)** – to distinguish correction vs crash  
- **7-Day Rolling Volatility** – to identify panic-driven instability  
- **Cross-Asset Comparison** – to check whether stress was systemic or asset-specific  

### Crash Benchmarks
- Single-day fall ≥ **10%**  
- Maximum drawdown ≥ **20%**

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- Gold and Silver experienced sharp declines, but **did not meet crash-level thresholds**
- Maximum drawdowns:
  - Gold ≈ **–10%**
  - Silver ≈ **–14%**
- Volatility spiked temporarily (especially in Silver) and later normalized
- The S&P 500 showed limited stress, confirming the event was **not market-wide**
- No statistical evidence supports claims of structural market manipulation

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The analysis shows that the event was a **correction, not a crash**.  
Social media reactions significantly amplified short-term fear, while market data indicates a controlled, macro-driven adjustment — with **Silver exhibiting higher risk than Gold**.
